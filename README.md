Ultra-fast, production-grade L7 reverse proxy and load balancer for modern platformssimple, extensible, and reliable.

## Overview

Helios is a modern, production-grade reverse proxy and load balancer for microservices. It combines intelligent routing (Round Robin, Least Connections, Weighted, IP Hash), active/passive health checks, low-overhead WebSocket/TLS termination, runtime control via the Admin API, and a pluggable middleware system—delivering high throughput, low latency, and effortless operations.

## Features

- **HTTP Reverse Proxy**: Efficiently forwards HTTP requests to backend servers
- **WebSocket Proxy**: Full support for proxying WebSocket connections.
- **TLS/SSL Termination**: Secures traffic by terminating TLS connections.
- **Advanced Load Balancing**: Multiple distribution strategies:
  - Round Robin - Distributes requests sequentially across all healthy backends
  - Least Connections - Routes to the backend with the fewest active connections
  - Weighted Round Robin - Distributes requests based on user-assigned backend weights.
  - IP Hash - Ensures requests from the same client IP are routed to the same backend.
- **Intelligent Health Monitoring**:
  - Passive health checks - Detects failures from regular traffic patterns
  - Active health checks - Proactively monitors backend health with periodic requests
- **Request Rate Limiting**: Token bucket algorithm to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Prevents cascading failures by temporarily blocking requests to unhealthy services
- **Metrics and Monitoring**: 
  - Real-time metrics collection and exposure
  - Health status endpoints
  - Backend performance monitoring
  - Request/response statistics
- **Configuration**: Simple YAML-based configuration
- **Performance**: Low memory footprint and high throughput
- **Reliability**: Automatic failover when backends become unhealthy
- **Admin API**: Runtime backend management, strategy switching, and JSON metrics/health
- **Plugin Middleware**: Configurable middleware chain (built-ins: logging, headers)

### Admin API

Helios includes an Admin API for runtime control and observability.

Configuration:

```yaml
admin_api:
  enabled: true
  port: 9091
  auth_token: "change-me"  # Optional; if set, protected endpoints require Bearer token
```

Endpoints (default port 9091):
- GET /v1/health — Admin API health (no auth required)
- GET /v1/metrics — Metrics snapshot (requires auth if configured)
- GET /v1/backends — List backends (protected)
- POST /v1/backends/add — Add backend (protected)
- POST /v1/backends/remove — Remove backend (protected)
- POST /v1/strategy — Change strategy (protected)

Examples:

```bash
# Health (no auth)
curl http://localhost:9091/v1/health

# Metrics (with Bearer token)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer change-me" http://localhost:9091/v1/metrics

# List backends
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer change-me" http://localhost:9091/v1/backends

# Add backend
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer change-me" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"b1","address":"http://127.0.0.1:8085","weight":1}' \
  http://localhost:9091/v1/backends/add

# Remove backend
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer change-me" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"b1"}' \
  http://localhost:9091/v1/backends/remove

# Switch strategy
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer change-me" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"strategy":"least_connections"}' \
  http://localhost:9091/v1/strategy
```

### Plugin Middleware

Helios supports a configurable middleware chain. Built-in plugins:
- `logging`: request/response logging with WebSocket support
- `headers`: set static request/response headers

Configuration example:

```yaml
plugins:
  enabled: true
  chain:
    - name: logging
    - name: headers
      config:
        set:
          X-App: Helios
        request_set:
          X-From: LB
```

Order matters: plugins run top-to-bottom.

### Testing TLS/SSL
To test TLS functionality, enable TLS in `helios.yaml`:

```yaml
server:
  port: 8080
  tls:
    enabled: true
    certFile: "certs/cert.pem"
    keyFile: "certs/key.pem"
```

Then access Helios via HTTPS:

```bash
curl -k https://localhost:8080
```

## Performance

Helios is designed for high performance and low resource usage:

- **Low Latency**: Adds minimal overhead to request processing
- **High Throughput**: Capable of handling thousands of requests per second
- **Efficient Resource Usage**: Low memory footprint and CPU utilization
- **Concurrent Processing**: Leverages Go's goroutines for efficient parallel request handling

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Health Check Endpoints

By default, Helios uses the `/health` endpoint for active health checks. You can customize this in the configuration:

```yaml
health_checks:
  active:
    path: "/custom-health-endpoint"
```

### Simulating Failures for Testing

The included backend servers support simulating failures for testing:

```bash
# Run a backend with a 20% chance of failure
./backend.exe --port=8081 --id=1 --fail-rate=20
```

### Logging and Monitoring

Helios provides detailed logging about backend health and request routing. The built-in metrics endpoints allow integration with monitoring systems like Prometheus by consuming the JSON metrics API.
